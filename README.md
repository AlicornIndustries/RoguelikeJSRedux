# RoguelikeJSRedux
A simple roguelike based on the ROT.JS framework, currently using CodingCookies' excellent guide on the topic.

Current extensions beyond CodingCookies' work:
* More complex combat and armor system
* Rudimentary skills system

Planned extensions:
* ASCII utility for drawing interactive skill/tech trees
* Ranged weapons and spells
